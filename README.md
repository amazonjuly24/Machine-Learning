Steps involved in linear regression:

1. Aim is to predict the dependent variable Y given the set of independent variable(features) X

2.The regression line equation is given by,
          Y = b + a*X 
                - where b is the y-intercept and a is the slope
                
3. Find pearson correlation coefficient(r)
  The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship 
  between two variables. 
                
4. Find y-intercept and slope

5. Substitute the slope and y-intercept values in regression line and view it.
